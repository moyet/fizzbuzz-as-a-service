# fizz-buzz-as-a-service

Are you tired of rewriting fizz buzz at every job interview, then this
package is for you. 

Just build the Docker container and run it on your favorite platform, 
and you now have a REST-api that should give you the results, you'll need.

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/fizzbuzz/135 

    $ FizzBuzz%

## Installation

You'll need a system with leiningen and Docker installed

To build to docker container just run make with:

    $ make uberjar build

Which should build the docker container called fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.

## Usage

You can start the docker container on your own computer with

    $ docker run -dp 3000:3000 fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz

To test that it works, try to call the service with curl, or
another web-client:

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/fizzbuzz/12
